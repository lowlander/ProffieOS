# ProffieOS

All credits to Profezzorn for starting this awesome project to get all our sabers and other props to the next level. 

This repository is our Art & Tech (VoF) fork of Profezzorn's master for ProffieOS. Wherever we can contribute we like to do so, and use our own forks for experimenting with the code. Some of our ideas or code might even find theyre way back into the main ProffieOS.
